/*
 * CPP template rule set
 * 
 * This file contains a set of rules that can be merged into
 * an existing configuration to provide protection against
 * malicious attacks to the control plane.
 * 
 * The rule set provides a default rate limit for packets
 * entering the control plane of 100kpps, and drops fragmented
 * packets.
 * 
 * Various routing protocols, such as RIP, BGP, etc, are exempted
 * from these constraints and will always be allowed to enter the
 * control plane. All other packets will be subject to the fragment
 * drop and rate limit rule. It may be necessary to add additional
 * rules if routing protocols using UDP or TCP are being fragmented
 * as any non-initial fragments will not be matchable by port number.
 * 
 * This template can be merged into existing configurations by using the
 * 'merge' command while in configuration mode.  When merged, this
 * rule set will also be assigned to the system loopback interface 'lo'.
 * 
 * This template is provided as a guide to providing CPP.  Adminstrators
 * are strongly encouraged to review RFC-6192 and modify this template
 * to suit their installations.
